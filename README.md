## KayBee DKMS
Just want to say this right here in the beginning: this is a module for *enthusiasts*, not malicious actors. Any key-logging, esp. at the kernel level, is obviously a huge long-term security risk! You should only really use this short-term when collecting data on your typing, which is also why I made it a DKMS module. **DO NOT** use this in high-risk or high-visibility scenarios!
